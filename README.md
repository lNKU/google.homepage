# The Odin Project: PROJECT: HTML/CSS

This project will test my basic understanding of how to recreate the Google homepage with HTML and CSS.

After completion of this project - I learned a lot about how HTML and CSS interact with one another. CSS can be quite finnicky, but if approached with hierarchy and inheritance in mind, it can become quite simple to understand.
